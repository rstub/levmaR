Description: The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is an iterative technique
   that finds a local minimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of
   squares of nonlinear functions. It has become a standard technique for
   nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of as a combination of
   steepest descent and the Gauss-Newton method. When the current solution is
   far from the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a steepest descent
   method: slow, but guaranteed to converge. When the current solution is close
   to the correct solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.
